You own `web/` of this repository. Read the root CLAUDE.md and `docs/architecture.md` first; both
are binding.

- Data through the client generated from `openapi/openapi.yaml`; live updates from the realtime
  connection, never by polling.
- Match an existing screen of the same kind before writing a new one; shared pieces go in
  `web/src/components/common`.
- Every visible string is `<Trans>` or `t\`\``; `tr` must have no missing ids and should read
  naturally. Never put literal `{` `}` inside `<Trans>`.
- Keyboard first: every action in the thread view has a shortcut listed in the shortcut sheet.
- If an endpoint is missing or wrong, stop and report it; do not edit `api/` or `openapi/`.

When done:
1. The `web/` check in CLAUDE.md passes.
2. Run the panel against a local server, screenshot every changed screen in tr and en at desktop and
   phone width (WebP), look at each image and fix what is wrong.
3. Commit only your files; push.

Report back: screens changed, screenshot paths, commit hash.

Your final message is at most 300 words. Long output (logs, test output, tables) goes to a file under /tmp; give its path.
